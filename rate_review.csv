"The printer comes with two large black ink bottles and one each of standard CMY.
It has some good features like inbuilt paper tray, manual feed, Wifi (by adding as a printer on your network, or by creating a hotspot on the printer itself and then connecting your phone to it). It gives you reasonable control over print and copy quality. You can change ink density so your prints consume less ink but look washed out. And here comes the catch. The print speed gets way low when you print in best q...

"One of the best printer in India. I research a lot and found the best one. Super fast speed. Please don't compare the printing speed with laser printer. In ink jet Printer category this is fastest. Colour printing is faster & better than epson printer. Single line display helps you a lot in print settings. You can get DCP -T420w @ price Rs. 1k less but i strongly suggest you to go for T520W. Both side ID/aadhaar/driving license /ration card printing function is superb. Many many customize o...

It is one among the best printer I have used. The print quality is good. I love the wireless printing feature and that's the best part. Worth more than the price,5
Excellent product print speed is fantastic but photo print speed is very slow copy quality mono and colour not good canon 2012 copy mono and colour good quality brother app good but very slow,5

"Don't get trapped by reviews

1-it's taking 10 minutes (yes you heard correctly ""minutes"") for color photo printing. And 3.5 to 4 mins in normal color printing.
2-engineer of brother came to my home he himself told that it will take that much time in printing.
3-even black and white printing is not up to the mark

So many issues.. Dont want to waste more of time..

Buy and repent.. Don't buy and thank me later 😊",2
"Looks like wifi card is not working, secondly, seller has given incorrect serial number in invoice.
Update : Brother executive came and resolve the problem by reinserting WLAN card. It took two minutes. He said this is known issue.",2

"Canon G3012 is the same as G3010 but with two extra black bottles of ink. So, this review is applicable for both the models. The flipkart delivery was on time and packing was satisfactory. Coming to the Printer.... The setup of easy. I was waiting for the Canon guy to come and install but then I decided to install it myself. Took me 15 mins to install. The print quality is satisfactory. Wireless printing setup was a bit typical but is a one time hassle. I took out some b/w and colour prints ...

"Very Nice Product
Printer is fast and smooth colours are good in compare to other printers in the market
The big plus point of buying Canon printers that they have seprate individual cartage for black and colour ink so it saves money while servicing of the product and Extra black ink bottels are also a big advantage.",5
"Superb printer. Easy to install. During this Covid 19 scenario, we were reluctant to do the installation by someone else. I was wondering whether I could do it by myself. But I did it at ease. Almost a plug and play time. Only cartridge to be inserted and inks to be filled, the rest is well taken care of by the printer itself. I tried photo printing, colour printing and b/w printing. I am really impressed. Photo printing I need to purchase glossy paper I think for better effect. The price is ...

Value for money Product. Go for it. better than Epson.
Quality of printing is excellent. I have got this product at Rs.12049 on Big Billion Day Sale and I am fully satisfied with this product.",4
"Satisfied with the printer.
Color page cost I am not sure as Canon claims but I have yet to check it.
Black ink for sure works quite well. Have taken around 50 pages and still the level of ink hasn't deteriorated.

Sending it after using it for almost 4 months. The printer is really worth.
Color print quality is good though the color seems to fade away in few months (can be because i kept the photos in open stick to my refrigerator or the paper quality might not be really good.)",4
Good Printer I use just 1 Week it's good quality but Slow printing but WiFi working is smooth and Fast,4
"I have been using Epson's L555 for close to 5 years and bought this as a backup. On the plus side I would say that the colour and scan speed is slightly better in comparison to the Epson. The sturdiness, fit and finish, print speed and noise levels could do with some improvement. In all I would rate this as a good product and am happy with it.",3
"Have been using this printer for last 2 weeks and it's good so far. The setup was ok, had some hiccups in configuring Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz (no 5 GHz), but could able to manage it with the USB connection, Support for Windows & Android is good, but doesn't support Airprint. The printing speed is good, since it's Inktank the yield is also good & advantage of having 2 additional Black ink bottles. The print quality & speed of both Black & Colour printouts are good, Scanning & Copier options are also goo...

"Good product. Tried installing myself watching YouTube videos, but was getting P03 error after all installation is done. Had to call in Canon engineer to resolve. Root cause was, something got struck in printer head path.
Got to know that free installation service is provided by Canon, but not mentioned in the Flipkart description.
So, do not try to install yourself. Just call Canon customer service, register warranty and ask for installation service.

"Its a genuine product. Don't look much or else you will get confused. It comes with 3 big black ink bottles and 3 colour bottles. The Wifi variant of this printer comes with same specifications and costs around 3-4k more. What I think is that theres no need of paying 3-4k extra for wifi as you can print the same using otg from your mobile device. Otg costs only 199. Dont listen to the negative comments as some products may have manufacturing defects but that doesn't makes all products bad. Ca...

I neve used high print quality mode only used standard print quality mode but print quality is very nice. Earlier I had HP 319 printer but trust me this canon printer is much better than HP in terms of ease of usage, handling, paper pickup and print quality. The printer cost me 11,300/-.",5

Very nice and economic printer. Go for it,4
Well product is good as we all know canon printer are the best as compared to others. And if you want to buy this product it will be good but be sure that the ink used is only pG-47 and CL-57 that is specific for it.. and the cost of this ink cartridge is heigh .. it gives only 250 pages for black and white and aroun180-200 coloured. And the scanning speed is bit slow as compared to other canon printer. It is best for personal use only.,4

But the finishing of the product is terrible. The front & top faces are fine but the back & inner portions are terribly casted. Also the scanner tray is not so rigid.
So I would suggest to spend few more bucks & go for HP M1005.

Suggestions for buyers and users-
1. If you think that printing cost is high then try refilling the cartridge. It cost 150 rupees per bottle of ink and has 100 ml. Cartridge can be refilled upto 20-25 times from ink bottle. After refilling the printing cost of color mode comes down to 0.99 to 1.20 rupees and black 0.30 rupees estimated by me.

Very slow print speed specially when you print a pdf and if you are doing both side then it is going to take a lot of time. The seller has put a template in the image section where it says that 38./. Faster than previous hp models but my 8 years old hp J1000 inkjet is much faster than this. Note: The xerox speed is good and print quality is top notch.,2

It's a nice product for the price good sound quality and also it maintains a good bass also but it not suitable for play pubg very deficult to spot enimes mi basic headset is better for play pubg at this price range,3
These earphones are pretty basic yet they fail to provide the bare minimum one expects from budget oriented earphones. Boat is known for its bass and sturdy built quality and both were missing in this model. The wire length of the earphones are small and doesn't provide the extra freedom to move whem plugged in. BOTTOM LINE put few more bucks and go for basshead 225 or 220 or if you are short on cash Flipkart smart buy basic earphones are still better than this one.,5

"This earbuds are Equipped with 10 mm dynamic drivers, which delivers sharp highs and a powerful bass performance so that we can enjoy every beat of your favorite soundtrack. They provide up to 5 hours of playback time on a single charge, which can be easily extended to about 30 hours using their charging case.",5
This Earbuds are pretty good but still not so satisfying the bass is poor high treble sound quality is ok but not good. Every 5 min battery drops by 10% but still giving 2 hrs+ backup and total 9 hrs. As I noticed this is good for those who just use it on low volume. Low volume performance is good but high volume is terrific. I suggest not to buy it.,5

"It's ok for the price. The build quality is actually better than what I expected. Both of the sides have magnets but it's not very strong. Speaking of sound quality, it's good for calls but not good for music. If you are buying this earphone for music purposes then I recommend use an equaliser or a bass booster. I tested the earphones and I barely got 2 hours of battery. The microphone works great and it's good for online classes. The charging time is 2.5 hours but it depends on what kind of ...

Cons -
1. I Own 2 bluetooth Neckbands and 4 pairs of TWSs. The Trüke Q1 has the shortest range. The signal disconnects long before 10 meters.
2. No volume control
3. If you play heavy music, it starts cracking. I'm a Metalhead, but these buds are just not for the genre. It's fine for light music & Audiobooks.

It's a nice product for the price good sound quality and also it maintains a good bass also but it not suitable for play pubg very deficult to spot enimes mi basic headset is better for play pubg at this price range,5
These earphones are pretty basic yet they fail to provide the bare minimum one expects from budget oriented earphones. Boat is known for its bass and sturdy built quality and both were missing in this model. The wire length of the earphones are small and doesn't provide the extra freedom to move whem plugged in. BOTTOM LINE put few more bucks and go for basshead 225 or 220 or if you are short on cash Flipkart smart buy basic earphones are still better than this one.,5

Nice product Fast delivery good design voice clarity excellent good bass,5
"2 weeks of usage.

I am happy with the product. When it delivered slightly a hesitation came. Here is my genuine review or opinion.

Battery backup is awesome. Sound clarity is great. Bass is fair enough for me. Design is comfortable to hold and carry anywhere.

FM working flawlessly. obviously, reaching the threshold level in volume then feeling slight distortion. But I am not expecting that much from this product at this price.

So far no issues. Worth money. I am glad got some time to wri...

"Pros:
1. Amazing combination of bass and treble
2. Sturdy body
3. No sound distortion at max volume
4. Good haptic feedback on tactile buttons
5. FM control and scanning is smooth
6. Extra louder volume in USB and AUX mode
7. Decent charging speed and good backup if battery

Cons:
1. The body is made if shining plastic which attracts fingerprint smudges. Rugged or matte finish would have been better
2. Calls landing on the speaker while on Bluetooth mode is troublesome
3. No card slot

Best Camera For the Beginners... Totally Loved it... Better experience.. Happy with the Service... Get the Product on time... Thanks..🙏☺️,5
This is my first Canon eos 1500d Camera and I'm very satisfied with this camera. Thank you so much to the flipkart for nice services.,5
"I am reviewing this product after two years of usage :

Camara is awesome for personal use, if you are beginner and looking for Camara only to use personal use and for small use at professional level then it is more than perfect.

I love this product and thanks Canon to make my valuable memories alive.",5
Awesome product for someone like me who likes to click photo's but photography is only like an hobby.,5
Excellent product packaging that comes with fantastic lens and the capture mood with its auto focus is just awesome........ I would recommend that this camera takes you to the another colourful vista ......Best product to buy in affordable price.,3
Good quality pics its a better selection for beginers but i am using 70-300mm lens for telescopic range of photos .I am satisfied with this model thank you canon.,5
"Good product, I'd say it is the best entry level camera, I bought the dual lens kit and it was completely worth it. But if you are comfortable with increasing your budget I'd recommend you the Nikon 5600D.",5
This is an awesome camera only good for photos if you want it for video don’t even look at it. Only good for photos you will easily see the improvement form a regular phone camera. But only buy it for photos.,4
"Best for photography, but its not good if you wanna shoot videos coz its autofocus is not good. And I’d suggest you to buy a prime lens for better portraits and for low light conditions.",5
"I am a beginner when it comes to photography. I am a blogger, I post recipes. The first appeal to the recipes is pictures. People first feast with their eyes. So I started learning about photography and decided to buy this EOS 1500D DSLR. It's awesome, the features are easy to understand. There are so many things I am yet to explore. Overall I am happy I chose to buy this.",3
"Bought this DSLR on Big billion sale. Very happy with the performence through 18-55 stm lens. Some sample photos which I have transferred to my mobile, are attached here. I am extremely happy with its low light performance. All the photos here are unedited. I was bit confused between M50 and 200d mark II but atlast choosed the later one for its wide variety of lens options.",5
"So, The camera comes with a standard lens to get you started. The build quality is great. Feels good in the hand. Lightweight and compact. This comes with the new Digic 8 image processor. And does a fine job out of the box. And editing some photos may also shock you with excellent results. 10/10 Will recommend. If you're a beginner and looking to stick with a DSLR and grow with it then look no further. I've added 2 of the best photos I took with the stock lens. Used Lightroom to finish it off.",5
"Satisfied..!
Best mid range camera for beginners and pros as well.

I attached some pics shot by 50mm 1.8 prime lens
Best for photo and video as well .
Eye autofocus works well .",5
"Product is amazing, The Build quality is nice and the image quality is awesome. The auto focus is smooth as butter. Best for videos.",5
"This is my first DSLR and it's amazing.

I can take sharp photos seamlessly.

I am not quite satisfied with it's low-light performance. Both the kit lenses are not that great for low light. You'll either need to increase the ISO sensitivity or the shutter speed and in either ways the image won't be that great.

The overall performance is great and I'm planning to take more and more pictures.",3
"So this is the review post 1 month of use.

Honestly speaking I wanted to buy 700d, then 750d, then 800d, then 200d then finally got 200d Mark II. (Just understand the feeling, don't use too much logic here)

So basically speaking, waited a lot, explored a lot, then finally spent a lot and for this one.

So I am no professional photographer but not that amature as well. It's been 1 month I've been using it, exploring the features and what I can say is ""it's a great camera"".

"I was actually looking for a action camera and then insta360 one r popped up during my searches. The most interesting thing about one r twin edition is that it's a modular one and you can change between the camera modules. So for the price of a regular action camera I literally managed to get two cameras.
Pros
1. The modularity of it makes it very much versatile.
2. The one-r app is awesome and easy to work with and has a lot of self learning options and pre loaded AI works that you can use ...

"TRAGIC BATTERY LIFE. No one warned me before buying that it's battery lasts only for an hour and take 2-4 hrs to charge. What a damn!

Also, this doesn't comes with a charger, just a type C Cable. Though you can use old Samsung less than 2A chargers since GoPro says to use max 2 A chargers since it's battery is only 1220 mah and ideal charging is 1.5A only. And Official GoPro charger costs around 4K and doesn't comes in box. A spare battery costs min Rs.1800. So overall they are looting us.

Not good for Indoor Videos.
Your phone might do a better job in case of Indoor videos than this camera. Noise in indoor videos is way too much.

However, I beleive its good for outdoor usage.

The Go Pro Hero 8 is a very nice product. It records really nice videos but the battery drains out very fast. It gets hot easily too.,5
Nothing more to write than is already written. Quality product. One of the best out there. Great price at time of purchase but now available at an even better price. But of a learning curve for first time users like me. Also be ready to shell out some more bucks for much needed accessories and extra batteries.,5
I brought GoPro Hero 8 mid of December from Flipkart. I am fully satisfied with camera and features only worst thing is battery. It suppose last for 2hr back up as instructed by GoPro but it lasts only for an Hour. Where as my friend has same model which has good battery back up up to 2hr.,5
Really satisfied and you can blindly go for it ❤️,5

"This earbuds are Equipped with 10 mm dynamic drivers, which delivers sharp highs and a powerful bass performance so that we can enjoy every beat of your favorite soundtrack. They provide up to 5 hours of playback time on a single charge, which can be easily extended to about 30 hours using their charging case.",5
This Earbuds are pretty good but still not so satisfying the bass is poor high treble sound quality is ok but not good. Every 5 min battery drops by 10% but still giving 2 hrs+ backup and total 9 hrs. As I noticed this is good for those who just use it on low volume. Low volume performance is good but high volume is terrific. I suggest not to buy it.,5

Speaking of sound quality, it's good for calls but not good for music. If you are buying this earphone for music purposes then I recommend use an equaliser or a bass booster.

But then you have to compromise for its ergonomics as they are little heavy and can come out ...

The build quality was excellent and the display will help you a lot what is charging percentage is and sound quality was really amazing the bass lovers can enjoy the bass a lot and the charging backup is something around 42hr and the best thing i have liked in this is Type c cable this is really amazing we can't see in many ear pod's with type c charging cable.The best,5
Best TWS in this price range. Very good bass and music. One of the best TWS in this price range i have ever tried.,4
"Genuine review after daily use:

I agree that the product is cheap. Very affordable price
But...
1. Sound quality is good for fresh users, not for those who have already experienced good earphones. This cannot be compared to boat/realme/OnePlus/oppo or the like.
2. Bass is fine but we can't listen it in volume for long time. Causes pain as opposed to other products.
3. Call quality is very poor. The person at the other end complained about my sound. Environmental Noise Cancellation is a lie.....

"If you haven't heard music before from expensive earphone or buds then you will definitely like the sound quality.
Sound quality is more towards bassy side due to which vocals and instrumentals muffled.
You can counterbalance this by using equaliser settings, i have made best equaliser setting for rich music which have rich deep suround bass, crystal clear vocals, perfect instrumentals and excellent highs-mids-lows.
After applying these settings i can assure you these buds will more sound lik...

Noise cancellation is very superb experience with another level. Good battery backup and easy to carry .
This is very comfortable and stylish buds.
Worth it go for purchase",5
Sound of the buds is very clear with great quality bass. Buds and case both looks very premium and also light in weight. Mic and noise cancellation working fine. Bluetooth range is quite far. Good for gamer as well as music lovers. Battery backup is also very good with fast charging too.,5
Very nice quality ear buds.Very premium look in this price range and bass is also too high.Its plastic material quality is much good than any other earbuds.It is also best for gamers because it has a dedicated gaming mode.Overall it is good ear buds in this price range.,5
Nice product.. Good sound quality.. Good fittings.. Good bass.. Good battery backup.. Good gaming mode.. 👍,5
"Very good , sound is like 8d , very nice at good price , but battery was not good , but it is very cheap , it was like apple airpods , must buy",5
Just ok. But it takes some time to connect. Product design is good. But battery is very bad. Because if you enjoy listening to something for 1 hour it goes off quickly and warm . But i feel the charging time is very short and it changes in 30 minutes. One thing is that its shape is soo good that it does not cause ear pain to some extent. So Iam happy to adjust with this product and rate,3

The product is very good in this price range.
The bass is good but the singing quality could have been better, it would have been better if you listened to music around 70% of the mobiles.
And the charging speed is one of the best feature of this product.
And the magnetic on and off feature works very well.
By design it is an average product but the other features are very good.

"I was very tired listening to a popular headphone brand starting with Bo...With all the heavy bass thrown in, the finer nuances of music was very lost. This headphone, well, doesn't bring out that much quality as a 2000 plus wired headphone does but what it gives is a great and very VFM output considering the sound it delivers and the price one has to pay for it. Liked it extremely for a great sound for such a small amount of money. The sound is crsisp with decent amount of bass thrown in. Ob...

"This pair of earphones has been a good purchase. There is no need for one to go for products from Skullcandy, JBL, Senheisser, etc...(People are going to appreciate them only for a day or two. Brands don't assure quality, in my opinion)

Get yourself a decent pair of earphones that don't cost you a fortune. This product certainly meets all the requirements you can possibly think of.",4

Sound and is ok, But Im not Satisfied with this Airpods type Design. It makes ears 👂Painful while watching Movies or using it long time. There is no volume Control option only Pause and Play button is available. There are Many Other Options available in this budget.",3
"Most of the earphones you get at this price are filled with bass. That bass overpowers everything and all the vocals, instruments in music get destroyed. These realme buds classic are perfectly balanced for me. The bass only appears when it is needed, that's what I like about these earbuds. If you're a bass head you'll hate these, but for beginner audiophiles and more normal users like me, these buds are perfect on a tight budget. The build is good too. The wire is made of a TPU - kind - of m...

The price of Mac mini and other CPUs are narrowing down now. Even with the base version of 8/256 GB the performance is awesome. Its better than Intel I5 I used earlier with Windows 10. Looks like M1 is much superior chip...probably like i7 or even better.,5
"It’s underwhelming. I have used MacBooks pros for years n started using a Mac air. While the Mac Mini seems faster in opening apps, the performance afterwards is very underwhelming. If I open chrome with a few tabs, excel and any one of the not-so-heavy trading apps like WazirX - I get the dreaded spinning flywheel. I’m forced to exit excel or chrome in that case.

I tried all options n called up apple as well. There isn’t any solution. I’m utterly disappointed",5

Full Gigabit and needs a full Gigabit connection

Range is good even on many blockage and speed doesn't dropped even in 2 wifi signals

Power On Time is near about 2min
High Temperature / Heating but doesn't affect performance",4

No drops in connection witnessed as of now. The 5g band gives the best speed but its coverage area is less than the 2.4g band. I have a 40mbps plan and using the 5g band, the speed test shows the exact speed.
Overall would recommend this router as it is comparatively very cheap at 1899. Better go with this than the 2 antenna routers.",4

Wonderful experience so far.This provides more than enough coverage for a small home or a normal flat / apartment as long as you place it properly in the middle of the house. File transfers in the home network maxes out around 400Mbps( in the 5gig band) so far in my tests. USB file sharing also works seamlessly as long as you are using a Windows laptop/PC. Since it comes with an option to wall mount it saves some space for you too.,5

"Works great. The ranges of both bands are good. 4 antennae helps with that. The UI of the router website is very clean for a quick setup. Guest network is also available. Low end phones might not capture the 5Mhz band. Check if your mobiles support 5Mhz. My Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 doesn't support but the Nokia 7 plus does! You have to be careful on that.

"Good product. Works perfectly, setup is easy. I am using it with both 2.4 and 5 gz bands. Both are working fine and no drops in speed and network. My main router is on ground floor and I install extender in first floor. Without extender my network speed on first floor was around 15-20 Mbps (my internet bandwidth is 70 mbps). With extender I am receiving around 60-65 mbps which is usually the speed I got. Even on terrace I got around 5-10 mbps , before I did not receive wifi signal.",4
Works fine setup is very easy. Not happy with range as i m getting 4 out 5 range when i am near by device,5
"Not a worthy product .. it works like 300 and not 750 kbps .. digisol are much better products.
Plz don't but this .. it works as a normal extender . It lags the speed in between",2
"Very easy to configure and use.
But lacks many firewall and control features.
Even after setting for highest transmit power/range, its transmit range is about 25% less than my existing Netgear WN3000RPv3 range extender and old D-Link range extender.
Note: Claims it supports WiFi mesh capability (proprietary OneMesh) with certain TP link routers for seamless WiFi handoffs within home. Since I dont have another Tp link router at present, could not test it.",4
wow this product is too good and this product quality is amazing I love this thank you Flipkart but delivery time is too long,5
I have bought this product in a hurry since I can get it delivered within a day with flipkart first. There was only 1 in stock and I was just in time in grabbing the opportunity. The range is fabulous and passes through more than 3 doors into my cabin. Am pleasantly surprised at the ease of use of the interface. The dual antenna coverage is really good. I am currently using it with ACT Broadband.,5
Good product delivered on time A real gem for your home/small office wifi need. The signal easily penetrates 2-3 walls and travels at least 10 meters. It's very easy to install it's working fine with act fibernet I will update the review of performance after 1 week I like the product,5
"Hi..
I ordered the product and got it delivered the next day. There are many reviews against Dlink 2750U but no reviews against DIR-615 so thought of writing this review.
Technically, 2750U is for Telephone line broadbands like bsnl,mtnl,airtel etc(bcoz it has RJ11 port for WAN link) and DIR-615 is for Cable line broadbands(as it has RJ45 port for WAN link).
DIR-615 is highly recommended for people using any local cable broadband, tikona broadband(has RJ45 port for WAN) etc. I had previousl...

Quadrupled my speed at home. There are 4 important points I'd like to make:

1) All these years I paid for a 50mbps speed from my cable company. I had an older Nertgare from 2009 which has served me well all these years (and still works) but I decided it was time to upgrade. Typically I was getting only 12-17mbps through my wi-fi (for example, to my iPhone6). After getting this Router, I now get 57mbps on the same iPhone. All of my devices are much faster now...

But Let Me Explain, If you Want The Speed switch it into 5ghz band.. this band has the superior power of transmitting data faster but the range is too short because of high data transfer...

Once again Flipkart rocks with the fast delivery and excellent packaging

"I received this router a few days back.
The extra packing was great.

About the router :
I had a default BSNL UTStarcom which died after it got wet during monsoon, so I bought this router.

It looks good, doesn't heat up (gets a little warm after few hours--normal).

Setup is straightforward if you DON'T use the CD provided. (I used the CD for installation but couldn't get anywhere).
But then I simply connected the router to my phone-line, logged onto 192.168.1.1 and used its auto configure w...

I bought this product three days ago, as usual Flipkart's express delivery was on time.

"The good part is, easy to configure and consistent connectivity. The bad part is, low Wi-Fi range within the same hall (living room). As far as you are within 2 meters distance the speed is good. At this cost and technology, the TCO is not met. It could have been better and hope D-Link would do something to address the same. Thanks.",5
"Well, used this product before (bought from somewhere else), the piece worked for somewhere around 2 years, worked well, so ordered it again from flipkart.
The only problem i faced that too after 2 years was buttons stopped working.
Decent ADSL router for sharing household broadband via wifi. Ethernet works well too (it will, it is meant to :P).
Well this is a electronic product, specs can be read at site, m just commenting on usage experience :)",5
"Went through multiple sites and stores before buying this, Flipkart gave the best deal. The product was genuine, branded and the packing was excellent.

Delivery was not good as the courier guys did not deliver it at home. They asked to come to their office to pick up the consignment.

"First of all, It's working good.
3STAR is because 5ghz range is very low. Please note that it says 1200mbps output in the model AC5 but the input speed is only upto 100mbps. This, it won't give speed more than 100mbps.

"Delivering what promised on description. I wish it had career aggregation and a port for voice set connection at this price. It would have been wonderful. However, speed depends upon the Mobile SIM network strength. WiFi range is acceptable. I have 3600 square feet house and i get 2.4 Ghz pretty good inside the house, however 5Ghz strength reduces most. Still good to buy.",5

Great product. Excellent signal strength after range extending. I got very fast streaming in places where earlier nit even a signal. Must go for it.,5
"Does it's job really well. I use this in a 3500 sq. foot house and the signal comes in every corner of the house. My house has relatively thick walls but the 5Ghz signal still manages to get through.

I have a 100mbps connection and the 5Ghz band gets the 85 Mbps of the 90mbps from the router (sometimes 5mbps more on both).

It is 1750 Mbps (network) (5G+2.4G) and my PC showed 1Gbps on the network properties (connected via Ethernet on the 5Ghz band). Plex is really fast on my local network ...

"Does the job perfectly well for what it's intended for! No speed drops whatsoever, even if I use the 5ghz band from the previous wifi dead zone of my house I get almost full speed of 5ghz of 150 Mbps.

But the downfall is that it does not cover the other room which is almost adjacent to it. The 5ghz coverage is really low and the TV in my living room picks up the signal from my main router instead of the extender which is actually further away from the extender. If I need to use 5ghz on my s...

Long term usefulness is not that great. After few months it got slower. Actually it has some issues so will not recommended if you are a nerd.",4
This device does not support one mesh technology of TP link,4
"Drastically reduces speeds. I should have returned it but kept trying, thinking it would work. Now I have a device which is useful to reduce Internet speeds",5

Product is very good. It provides superb WiFi speed. Signal strength is very good.,5
If you want to buy real gigabit router in low price go for it. Others on this price will tell gigabit but actually they are not. If LAN/ WAN speed is 100 Mbps then what is the use of 1200 router speed? Input is bound to 100 then at most you will get 100 Mbps from router. If you purchase higher band plan (more than 100 Mbps) from your service provider then also it will work because LAN and Wan speed is 1gbps for this router.,5

Build quality is very good. Easy setup. Features like firewall and DDoS security is available. Wifi speed is up to the mark. 2.4GHz coverage is good but speed is not as expected. 5GHz speed is very impressive but coverage is very low.",4
This the advanced router according to its budget. I got delivered this yesterday and after setup it works so fine along with dual band. This is enough capable to cover a 2bhk apartment. Happy to purchase this.,5
5Ghz works good with good speed ...it's coverage is upto a single floor ... 2.4Ghz coverage is good and speed is slightly week,5
"Perfect for small to medium size home. The dual bandwidth is capable to deliver great speeds without any disconnections while you roam in your house.

I have 200Mbps Broadband plan and it always delivered around 210-230 mbps which is crazy. Can support upto 1Gbps. Also, price is very competitive with other brands.

Go for it. You will never get disappointed.",5

Not a good product. 5ghz band works good for shorter range but 2.4 ghz band although covering good range doesn't give good speed. I have 100Mbps plan and 2.4 ghz band gives about 20~25 Mbps speed in 5m distance from router which is very poor . For this I purchased a new router tp link archer c6 and its 2.4 and 5 ghz bands works fantabulous.So if anyone intersted in purchasing a good router overall buy tp link c6 as it supports mesh network.,3

"I had been looking at mivi products from a long time and this is my first one. Got it today and the audio quality is amazing. Not what you expect from a compact low budget speaker. Haven't tried out the battery completely but if I get around 10hrs thats enough for me.
The volume is amazing but I don't know if it will be enough in a party or something with people talking everywhere. For me this is the most value for money speaker available.",5

It has only a single channel. That means it only produce mono sound fill in dual speaker. Unlike other stereo speakers with left and right channels. It support TWS mode. If you have two product you can pair ...

Battery backup stays for atleast 5 days. I've never seen such good battery backup with Bluetooth speakers. Sound quality for a 5W speaker us too good to be true. Charging takes about 1.5 hours to 2 hours. I would say that its a good buy for a portable Bluetooth speaker. I really loved it!,5

Loved the speaker..... Budget friendly and compact product with good sound quality. Bass sound in a bit weak but the speaker will meet your requirements for basic gaming and playing songs or surfing youtube. Especially at this price point the RBG lighting and such sound quality is bonus.

Sound: Very good, ideal for casual listening and music on the go. I use it with my laptop as it augments sounds from it. It has good bass & comes with dual eq: one named normal and the other deep bass. The later increases the bass by a factor more than two. Vocals are clear and has good higher frequency response. You would not be disappointed with it.

This rating is genuine.",5
"The speaker has the same rich sound as of other JBL speakers and despite of being small the sound has a thump to it when in deep bass mode and the sou d doesn't gets distorted at full volume though you can feel a little drop in vocals when the bass kicks in but this is due to the mono speaker as it has to do all the work

Best buy in low budget. Sound quality is not that great however sound clarity is pretty good. I recommend to put some more money and get a good quality sound system if you are a music lover. It's good for people with low budget who are ok with so so sound system clarity. The material used is low quality so eventually you have to replace your system may be in a year or two. All functions mentions work perfectly fine. Good for your bedroom. Not recommended for living room.,5

"I am very happy with Boat Partypal 60, 20 watts Bluetooth Party Speaker. It has most of the features I needed along with good quality sound and the Karaoke mic. So despite not being the loudest, this speaker is quite impressive with its good bass response and sound clarity.

Although, there are many options available in the market I could somehow trust the Boat brand having used a few Boat products before and I am glad I did that. High quality distortion free sound even at peak volume which i...

"I had been looking at mivi products from a long time and this is my first one. Got it today and the audio quality is amazing. Not what you expect from a compact low budget speaker. Haven't tried out the battery completely but if I get around 10hrs thats enough for me.
The volume is amazing but I don't know if it will be enough in a party or something with people talking everywhere. For me this is the most value for money speaker available.",5

Speaker has balanced sound , it gives very pleasant sound, vocals aren't sharpened, and tends to on the side of natural and bass is impressive . I myself found one crazy thing about the speaker , we can keep it at different angles - straight, at 45 degree, at 90 degree and I found that for extreme bass lovers speaker should be kept at 90 degree , for best mids - 45 degree and those who love balanced or like a sound which has treble with a pinch of bass the best is to keep it straight ...

I'm not a very big fan of Speakers. I generally prefer earphones because I've to take classes but for some time I'm facing pain and irritation in my ear so I'm looking for moderate budget speakers for my desktop and I found this deal for Rs. 450 and it is pretty much affordable so I bought these speakers and they are doing well for me and they are also loud enough and having decent quality if you're someone who is looking for desktop or laptop speakers under Rs. 500 you can definitely go for it,5
Sound quality of this speaker is good but bass is not good it is only decent but in this price speaker is very good l got this speaker 539Rs,3

1.Charging time with 18W charger is 7 hours. With 10 watt charger it takes 10.5 hours to charge completely.
(If your charger is 15W , it will still take 10.5 hours to charge).
2. It doesn't have a power on/off button. There is a battery level indicater button on side. When you press it once, it will show the battery level remaining.
If you press it twice, it will go on low- current discharge mode when you can charge devices like Bluetooth headphones and smartbands.
